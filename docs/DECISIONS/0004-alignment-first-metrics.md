# 0004 Alignment-First Metrics

## Date
2026-02-20

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Eric’s mission requires non-vanity metrics tied to Spirit/Soul/Body and the priority matrix. The system must avoid "brand" and activity metrics that drive drift.

## Decision
Implement alignment scoring and drift flags based on the Monthly Survey, and surface them on the home dashboard and reviews before any growth or vanity metrics.

## Consequences
- Ensures data reinforces spiritual and family priorities.
- Sets guardrails for AI automations (triggered only by alignment signals).
- Metrics dashboard remains minimal and mission-aligned.
