# 0003 Starter Backlog Scope and Sequencing

## Date
2026-02-20

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The starter backlog defines a large scope (home dashboard, calendar, reviews, survey scoring, metrics, AI automations). The system must keep God/Health/Family/Impact alignment central while remaining usable and minimal.

## Decision
Sequence delivery into feature sets that maximize alignment signal first:
1) Home dashboard + alignment banner + today view
2) Tasks v2 (categories, recurrence, "why")
3) Calendar module (recurring events + links)
4) Monthly Review + Survey + scoring + archive
5) Metrics dashboard (minimal)

## Consequences
- Prioritizes mission alignment visibility before advanced automation.
- Data model changes are staged and reviewed per feature set.
- Keeps scope small enough to maintain momentum.
